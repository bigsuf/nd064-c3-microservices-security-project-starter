1. How will you test the changes?
we will using testing envirment as sandbox cluster, the sandbox cluster will mimic production cluster to maximize the accuracy of tests.
this should be achievable via declarative configurations, and a portion of the production traffic will be redirected to the sandbox cluster via load-balancer or service-mesh configurations.
This is good practice that we can implement as part of our deployment strategy and Software Development Lifecycle.

2. How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
 The change will be tested in a sandbox cluster as described above.
 Once the change is applied in Production, I will monitor metrics via the observability stack.  
 Therefore, if we found any error in latest version we can roulback the cluster to previous version.
