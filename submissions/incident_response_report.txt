1. Incident commander name:
A cryptomining attack

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods running three different crypto miners were launched, A attacker was able to launch a script onto the cluster using kubectl.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker was able to get control of the cluster and run containers on the cluster.
Attackers are after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining. This is related to the crypto miners being started.
The attacker was able to execute the pods with kubectl, which means they have access to an administrative terminal and the kubeconfig file.

4. Summmry of the impact:
The attacker managed to run crypto miners on the cluster. Usually, crypto-mining consumes a lot of CPU.
The Kubernetes resources dashboard in Grafana shows the significant spike in CPU utilization.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
- Kill damaged pods by using this command `kubectl delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force`
- Verify CPU activity stabilization
- review adminstration roles on kubernates API
- Configured Admission controllers to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
It is good to have monitoring like Grafana dashboards. It would be helpful to have alerts from Falco for events like this.
